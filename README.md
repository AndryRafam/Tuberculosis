# Tuberculosis
This little project is about classifying tuberculosis (X-ray imagery).

#### The dataset can be downloaded from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/tuberculosis-tb-chest-xray-dataset

## We are essentially using two methods in order to achieve our goal.
  ALL DATASET ARE AUGMENTED.
  - The first one is to build a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) from scratch.
  - The second is to use transfer learning technique (feature extraction).

## Result of the experiment
### CNN from scratch (Tuber folder):
  - Test accuracy: 96.25 %
  - Test loss: 10.61 %
